Python

Streamlit

Pandas

Requests

## File Descriptions:
Movie_recommendation_system.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the exploratory data analysis.

app.py: This Python script uses Streamlit to create an interactive user interface for the movie recommendation system. It includes functions for fetching movie posters and displaying recommendations.

## To use this application:
Clone this repository to your local machine.

Run the code cells in Jupyter notebook

After performing EDA, dump the cleaned data into local machine using pickle library

Install Python and necessary libraries like Streamlit, Pandas, and Requests.

import cleaned data into python file

Run command - "streamlit run app.py".This will start the web application for the movie recommendation system.
